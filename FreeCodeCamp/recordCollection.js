/*Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire records object.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. You should not directly modify the recordCollection object.
